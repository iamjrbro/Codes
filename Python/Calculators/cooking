'''
COOKING CALCULATOR

This code develops a program, using If/Else + Range, that, based on the temperature of the steak (in Fahrenheit), returns the cooking point.

     -> the user must enter the temperature of the steak.

                Temperatures

                120°F  Rare
                130°F  Medium rare
                140°F  Medium
                150°F  Medium well
                160°F  Well done
