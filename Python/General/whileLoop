# This example creates a sale promotion for a product, which will start with the sale price at $100 and will get $5 off every day. However, the loop ends when the value reaches the $20 limit.

value = 100
day = 0

while value > 20:
    day += 1
    print(f'At day {day} the product will be sold for ${value}')
    value -= 5




'''
WHILE LOOP CONDITION

Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true
'''

'''
Hypothetical ecommerce which has a 10% commission on top of the price of the product, if it has a value above $20.
In this example, the loop has a break, that will stop the loop as soon as the result of the calculation return to the user.
