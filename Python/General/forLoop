Creating a design

FOR LOOP - NESTED LOOPS

A loop inside another.
'''

# outer loop
# inner loop

'''
In this case, the first loop will execute the first number/letter/sentence and the loop within it will run completely, then the first loop will execute the second number/letter/sentence, and the second will run completely again, and so on
'''

# 1

for number1 in range(5):
    print(number1)
    for number2 in range(5):
        print(number2)



# 2

for number1 in range(5):

FOR LOOP - NUMBERS
'''

# print 1 to 5

'''
In this case, the code will print numbers 0 to 4, not including number 5, due to index
'''

for number in range (5):
    print(number)


'''
In this case, the code will print numbers 1 to 4, not including number 5. However, this one doesn't print number 0 at the beggining
'''

for number in range (1,5):
    print(number)

FOR LOOP - SEPARATED STRINGS

Used to insert a space between each letter of the word (#2).
'''

# 1. modifing the word LIFE to L I F E (in this example, the letters will be one below the other)
